# Adobe Dreamweaver Vermillion

Vermillion is a demo magazine site to showcase dreamweaver's bootstrap integration.

The `html` and `css` can be edited outside of dreamweaver. When the project is opened in DW, the built-in grid manipulator is pretty nice to work with.

You probably won't need to edit `bootstrap.css` at all - this is just the basic foundations. All custom `css` should be done in `vermillion-theme.css`

This repo also contains "starter" files. These files are used by Adobe demonstrators. The starter files are slighty different, and are changed in the demo.
